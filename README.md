# Text-to-Audio Generation with Fine-Tuning & Hardware Optimization

## 1. Overview
This project explores Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation using advanced deep learning models, focusing on fine-tuning techniques and hardware efficiency. The research evaluates how GPUs and NPUs handle computational workloads for speech/audio synthesis, aiming to optimize both model quality and resource utilization.

Key areas include model parameters, audio features, and efficient fine-tuning strategies (LoRA, PEFT, quantization). The goal is to develop a framework for high-quality audio with reduced latency, memory usage, and energy consumption.

## 2. Objectives
- Analyze baseline performance of state-of-the-art Text-to-Audio models (FastSpeech2, VITS, HiFi-GAN).
- Study GPU utilization vs NPU utilization during training & inference.
- Understand model parameters and their impact on quality (hidden layers, embedding size, attention heads).
- Explore audio features (mel-spectrograms, pitch, prosody) for improved synthesis.
- Apply fine-tuning techniques:
	- LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
	- PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
	- Model Quantization (4-bit / 8-bit)
- Benchmark models across quality (MOS, WER) and efficiency (latency, throughput, energy usage).
